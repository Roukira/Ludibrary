# Ludibrary v0.1
Ludibrary is a (mostly hobby) project. It will allow users to list their games (on any platform)
and even launch them if they set them up to. It is using [thegamesdb database](http://www.thegamesdb.net) API to search for games and corresponding informations and image. (Thanks for this awesome database !)

Please keep in mind this is still an early version of what I'm aiming for.
