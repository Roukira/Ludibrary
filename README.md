# Ludibrary v0.2

A new version is out !

Changes : 
- I got rid of folders storage Data/etc... and I am now using a SQLite local database. It will allow later easy import/export.
- I've rewritten half of the program which makes it much faster and smoother, and got rid of most known bugs. The other half is set for later.
- I've implemented a settings feature to the software, and also a settings.ini file for easy import/export.
- Search bar is a lot faster, and there's a little animation gif while waiting.
- Edit button working for any game, which will allow to edit a game settings (for now only the exe path).
- You can now run any PC game added to the list, just by adding the exe path on the edit menu.
I've added a play button instead of double-clicking the game which I think is better.
- I got rid of global variables which were useful but quite messy. 
- More info added into settings and help menus.
- You can't now run 2 instances of the software, a warning message will pop up.
- The only setting available right now is smooth scrolling, which basically allows to scroll pixel per pixel.
- The app .exe now has an icon !

# Ludibrary v0.1
Ludibrary is a (mostly hobby) **Windows** software project. It will allow users to list their games (on any platform)
and even launch them if they set them up to. It is using [thegamesdb database](http://www.thegamesdb.net) API to search for games and corresponding informations and image. (Thanks for this awesome database !)

Please keep in mind this is still an early version of what I'm aiming for.
