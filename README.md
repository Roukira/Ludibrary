# Ludibrary v0.1
Ludibrary is a (mostly hobby) project. It will allow users to list their games (on any platform)
and even launch them if they set them up to. It is using http://www.thegamesdb.net database API to search for games and corresponding informations and image. (Thanks for this awesome database !)
