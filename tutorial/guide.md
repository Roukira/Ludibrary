# Tutorial
Hello there !
Want to know how to use the software ? Here is a quick and simple guide to get started.

![Main Menu listing all games](https://github.com/Roukira/Ludibrary/blob/master/tutorial/image3.PNG?raw=true)

First of all, start by adding your games, it will add automatically the platform if you don't have any game for it yet.
This will allow you to use emulators for the platform and even external softwares to run with the games you want to.

## Add a game to the library.

If it is a steam game, I recommend using the add detected PC games feature by pressing the + green button on screen.
Be warned though, this feature isn't perfect yet and might not detect your steam games.
Else, click on Search tab and then write on the search bar the game you desire to add to your library.
Press the ![Add Button](https://github.com/Roukira/Ludibrary/blob/master/tutorial/image.png?raw=true) and it will be added to your library.

After that you setup the game path by hovering over the game and pressing the edit button ![Edit Button](https://github.com/Roukira/Ludibrary/blob/master/tutorial/editbutton.png?raw=true).
After that, you can run the game (if it's an PC game) by pressing the ![Play Button](https://github.com/Roukira/Ludibrary/blob/master/tutorial/playbutton2normal.png?raw=true) button.

## Add an emulator to the library.

If your game is for another platform than PC, don't worry, you can still run it after adding your emulator to the list of emulators.
It's quite easy, all you have to do is press the ![plus button](https://github.com/Roukira/Ludibrary/blob/master/tutorial/buttonAdd.png?raw=true) button and select "Add Emulator".
With that done, a window will open, there you press the ![plus button](https://github.com/Roukira/Ludibrary/blob/master/tutorial/buttonAdd.png?raw=true) button again and select your emulator path and its platform(s).

## Add an external software to the library.

Adding an external software will allow you to run any software together with any game.
Just like the emulator, adding an external software is as simple as pressing the ![plus button](https://github.com/Roukira/Ludibrary/blob/master/tutorial/buttonAdd.png?raw=true) button and setting up the path and platform(s).
One more thing about it is that you can modify its setting by pressing the ![setting](https://github.com/Roukira/Ludibrary/blob/master/tutorial/settings1.png?raw=true) setting button on the top right of the main window.
You can also set up a game per game case if you want by pressing the edit button on each game, or platform case on settings as mentioned earlier.

Just one thing, current version will crash if you add an external software to a platform that you created without quitting the app in between. To avoid that, simply restart the app before adding an external software.
This is an error that will be fixed in next version.
